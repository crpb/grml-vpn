  1. autodetection of IPs on the local computer (should make -a nearly useless)
  2. better handling of "encryption" layers, let the user deside if tunnel/transport mode,
      or ah, or ipcomp (or only a few of them). something like --use esp-tun:ah:ipcomp.
      First use ipcomp to compress the data stream, then use ah on the package and then put
      the package into an esp tunnel.
  3. better stand alone script (also with autodetection of local IPs) - could be quite hard!!
